# Git Commit and Push Skill

Automatically stage all changes (including new files), create a commit, and push to the remote repository.

## Usage

This skill will:
1. Run `git status` to show what will be committed
2. Run `git add .` to stage all changes (including new files)
3. Create a commit with a descriptive message
4. Push to the remote repository (origin/main)

## Commit Message Format

Follow conventional commits format:
- `feat:` - New feature
- `fix:` - Bug fix
- `docs:` - Documentation changes
- `refactor:` - Code refactoring
- `style:` - Code style changes
- `test:` - Test updates
- `chore:` - Build/tool updates

Example:
```
